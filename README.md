# dotfiles

All the necessary files for my first rice posted to r/unixporn.
Unfortunately, I couldn't actually get the album art working in ncmpcpp; it only displayed the art for Jean-Michel Jarre's Oxyg√®ne, so I just kind of exploited it for the screenshot. 
For anyone who isn't as dumb as me setting it up in the early hours on no sleep, the project can be found [here.](https://github.com/alnj/ncmpcpp-ueberzug)

The window manager is AwesomeWM with the status bar(s) being Awesome wibars. The config for it is a little hackey but it gets the job done, and all keybindings are the defaults with addition of Super + = to show/hide the systray, which is hidden by default.

## WPGTK

[WPGTK](https://github.com/deviantfero/wpgtk) is a colour scheme generator and setter which can take a scheme from the colours in an image you provde, usually your wallpaper.

## Colours

![Colours](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Corvance/dotfiles/main/1617711124.png "The hex values for the colour scheme set in WPGTK.")

## Fonts

THe fonts used are [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [JetBrains Mono.](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)

## Kitty

[https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty] is the terminal emulator I use and my config is provided in the configs folder.

## tty-clock

tty-clock can be found [here.](https://github.com/xorg62/tty-clock). Arch users can install the package of the same name.

## Cowsay

Cowsay can be found [here.](https://github.com/tnalpgge/rank-amateur-cowsay). Arch users can install the **cowsay** package.

## Neofetch

I'd be pretty surprised if any linux user coming here didn't already have neofetch, but for anyone who's just starting out or maybe just didn't bother before, it's [here](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) with the Arch package being **neofetch**.

## Ncmpcpp

[ncmpcpp](https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp) is a terminal frontend for [MPD.](https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/MPD) Like I said before, I haven't provided the config files for them as it's kinda broken for me at the moment. Basic config can easily be found on places like the Arch wiki.

The music's just my local files, so only a small portion of what I listen to. If you want any recommendations, feel free to DM me on Reddit @ u/Corvance :)

## Ranger

[Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) is a terminal file manager written in Python. It can be installed with the **ranger** package, and I left the config at default as I felt it fit well enough with the colours.
